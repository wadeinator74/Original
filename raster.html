             		<h2>Photoshop Text and Filters</h2>
             		<p>This was by far my favorite picture out of all of the pictures I have done. I made it from scratch. First I put in the normal text. Then, I turned it sideways and used the wind tool twice. Next, i turned it back and liquified it so I could make the wind look like fire and acid. Finally, I did that twice once for fire and one for acid. Then, I put the two pictures together</p>
